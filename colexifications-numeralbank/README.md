# Analysis on colexifications

We cross the data in numeralbank-analysed with that on CLICS (colex2lang_data.tsv), in order to understand what bases are preferable when a certain base colexification occurs --this probably belongs to a new repository, shall I just copy numeralbank-analysed/cldf into a new rep for this?
